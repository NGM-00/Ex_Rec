# Spotify-Recommendation-System-With-Deployment

## Planing Stage
In This Project We Build a Spotify Recommendation System as a Machine Learning application

as We Know Spotify is a digital music, podcast, and video service that gives us access to millions of songs and Our Planning 
To build a Spotify Recommender System Using Spotify API.

## First What's A Recommendation System !!
One of the most used machine learning algorithms is recommendation systems. A recommender (or recommendation) system (or engine) is a filtering system which aim is to predict a rating or preference a user would give to an item, eg. a film, a product, a song, etc.

- Spotify use different types of Recommendation Systems which are:
    - Collaborative Filtering Algorithm (Based on users interactions of different track)
    - Content Based Filtering (Based on users demographics and tracks attributes)
    - Natural Language Processing (Based on analyzing tracks lyrics).
- In this project we build our Recommendation System to recommend similar songs to the user input, we used different algorithms which are:
    - Content Based Filtering
    - Clustering
## Data
Data came from 2 sources:
- API Calls of Spotify's Web API to get audio features for each track.
- The Spotify Million Playlist Dataset which contained Four separate JSON files
